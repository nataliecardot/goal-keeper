# Goal Keeper

A simple goal tracking app built using Vue.js for practice with Vue components, props, slots, and emitting custom events.

The user can add goals and click on them mark them as completed.

## Notes

I used the `webpack-simple` template to bootstrap the app.

To deploy to GitHub Pages, I used [vue-gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-gh-pages).
