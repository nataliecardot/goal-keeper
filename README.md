# Goal Keeper

A simple goal tracking app built using Vue.js for practice with Vue components, props, slots, and emitting custom events.

The user can add goals and click on them to mark them as completed, which displays them in a 'completed' section.

A maximum number of goals (the target number of goals) is set, with a progress bar indicating the number of goals that still need to be added.

## Notes

I used the `webpack-simple` template to bootstrap the app.

To deploy to GitHub Pages, I used [vue-gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-gh-pages).
